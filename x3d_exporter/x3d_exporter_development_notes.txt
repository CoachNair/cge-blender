The Blender X3D exporter with Kambi (Michalis Kamburelis)
fixes and modifications.

The idea is that you can replace your installed

  blender/2.78/scripts/addons/io_scene_x3d/export_x3d.py
  blender/2.78/scripts/addons/io_scene_x3d/__init__.py.py

with my version.

Based on 2.78 version currently (I try to keep up and always base
on newest releaed Blender version). I also keep the original version here,
to easily see my modifications by:

  diff -u original/export_x3d.py export_x3d.py
  diff -u original/__init__.py __init__.py

And apply my modifications to next release by:

  diff -u original/export_x3d.py export_x3d.py  > a.patch
  cp -f ...new_blender_release.../export_x3d.py export_x3d.py
  cp -f ...new_blender_release.../export_x3d.py original/export_x3d.py
  patch --dry-run export_x3d.py  < a.patch # check that there are no conflicts
  patch export_x3d.py  < a.patch
  # and repeat if with __init__.py
