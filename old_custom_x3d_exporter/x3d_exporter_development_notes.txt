The Blender X3D exporter with Kambi (Michalis Kamburelis)
fixes and modifications.

The idea is that you can replace your installed
blender/2.76/scripts/addons/io_scene_x3d/export_x3d.py
with my version.

Based on 2.76 version currently (I'll try to keep up and always base
on newest releaed Blender version). I also keep the original version here,
to easily see my modifications
(diff -u export_x3d_distributed.py export_x3d.py)
and apply my modifications to next releases
(diff -u export_x3d_distributed.py export_x3d.py  > a.patch
 cp -f ...new_blender_release.../export_x3d.py export_x3d.py
 cp -f ...new_blender_release.../export_x3d.py export_x3d_distributed.py
 patch export_x3d.py  < a.patch
 (assuming of course they can be applied automatically, i.e. the code
 around them didn't change upstream)).
