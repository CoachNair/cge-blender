Various comments about usage of VRML 97 Blender exporter,
both my version (in this directory, kambi_vrml97_export.py)
and the version distributed with Blender.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Texture is ignored if vertex painting was used.
  I guess that's because of VRML 2.0 feature that says that Texture RGB should
  make Color field ignored. This somewhat prevents using both vertex painting
  and texturing on one node (actually, not really, but I guess it's not
  easy to workaround for Blender exporter).

  Be sure to remove "Vertex colors" from mesh and "VCol Paint" from material
  if you want to see texture applied on the mesh.

  And be sure to set "TexFace" for material to take texture.

- It exports lights to VRML file. This is actually a very good thing,
  although it's something different if you were used to the fact
  that VRML 1.0 exporter doesn't touch the lights.
  Be sure to set lights the way how you want them for VRML.

  Although, there's a bug: DirectionalLight is set in stupid way
  that will not affect anything. (it's inside Transform grouping node).

- It exports camera for VRML file using correct way.
  VRML 1.0 exporter also exported camera but using brain-dead
  way (it just transformed whole scene to match camera...).
  So now you should just set your camera right for VRML file.

  Well, gravityUp is still stupid (it's always equal to cameraUp,
  which is not always what's needed). You may want to correct by
  view3dscene "Navigation -> Walk mode settings -> Change gravity up..."
  and then "Console -> Print Current Camera Node (VRML 2.0)"
  and add generated camera node to VRML file.

- It sets "solid" field of IndexedFaceSet (VRML browsers can do
  backface culling if this is TRUE) by looking at
  twosided property of geometry. So be sure to set this right in
  blender.

- It generated IndexedLineSet when the mesh drawing type
  is set to Wireframe in blender, but this is a little buggy:
  last index on each face is not connected with the first.
  I corrected this by regexp replace:
          \([0-9]+\) \(.*\) -1,
  to
          \1 \2 \1 -1,

- Beware that Camera visibilityLimit is exported.
  If you don't see anything on the scene in view3dscene Examine mode
  and in Walk mode you see only nearest parts, then probably your
  visibilityLimit is too small.

- Note about modifiers and armature: currently, the script doesn't
  apply modifiers, which I want to fix at some point (I know it's
  possible to apply modifiers from script, after all Wavefront
  OBJ exporter does this).

  Note that for this to work you will have to use armature by modifier,
  not by parenting.(You can convert old models by clicking "make real"
  to convert parenting to modifier).
  That's because there's no way yet to do "make real" from script.
  See [http://lists.blender.org/pipermail/bf-python/2006-September/004302.html].
  So it's best if armature is already a modifier, otherwise you will
  have to click "make real" each time before exporting.

  About armature modifier see e.g.
    http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Armature_Modifier
    http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Advanced_Tutorials/Advanced_Animation/Guided_tour/Mesh/Amodif
  Armature as modifier allows you e.g. to set VertexGroups/Envelopes
  setting per object, as opposed to "per armature" as previous.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things fixed in my version:

- Original exported doesn't care about smooth/solid/autosmooth etc., resulting
  in all objects being solid (flat shading).

  Our version respects set solid/set smooth/autosmooth/autosmooth degrees
  settings from Blender are correctly exports them to VRML file (as creaseAngle
  field). So objects markred as solid are solid, objects marked as smooth
  are fully smooth (if autosmooth off) or are smoothed according to
  autosmooth degree (if autosmooth on).

  The only case when this algorithm fails is when you used set smooth/set solid
  on only particular mesh parts. That is, if within one mesh, some faces
  are marked solid and some are marked smooth. Current implementation
  will treat this like every face was marked smooth.
  (This case cannot be handled by creaseAngle, it requires splitting the
  mesh into two parts for exporting or writing explicit calculated normals
  in VRML file.)
  (That said, this is not often found case, as on 99% of models you can get good
  normals using smooth with autosmooth adjusted.)

- Original exporter uses texture object name in Blender as texture URL.
  I don't know why. Update: this was about Blender <= 2.44.
  In Blender 2.45 it's fixed to use filename, but still strips path from
  filename without any reason (I like to have (possibly relative) path
  there.)

  Fixed in my version, to just insert texture filename.

- Original version rotates object so that +Z becomes +Y.

  Which is smart if you try hard to conform to VRML 2.0 rule that +Y
  is up and you like to design in Blender with +Z up... Actually, it's
  stupid as fas as I (Kambi) am concerned. I prefer exporter that tries
  to preserve as accurately as possible in VRML what I did in Blender.
  If I wanted +Y up, I would design in Blender with +Y up.

  The rule that "+Y is up" is not important in VRML --- you can set
  your camera such that gravityUp and up are +Z, if you want.
  Everything will work 100% correctly (until you will want to mix with
  models that have +Y up). Also. it's only usual in Blender to design
  with +Z up --- you can design in Blender with anything as "up".

  I understand that it's just a matter of preference. But my preference
  is strong in this case: I want to preserve X, Y, Z from Blender to VRML
  accurately. Conventions "what's up vector" are much less important then
  that.

  So in my exporter version this "feature" is removed.
